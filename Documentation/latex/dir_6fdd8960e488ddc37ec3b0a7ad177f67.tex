file \hyperlink{_finite_history_8h}{Finite\+History.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A Finite\+History stores the previous N examples of something of type T. This is used e.\+g. in M\+C\+MC in order to count the acceptance ratio on the previous N samples. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{_median_f_a_m_e_8h}{Median\+F\+A\+M\+E.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A streaming median class implementing the F\+A\+ME algorithm Here, we initialize both the step size and M with the current sample \href{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.7376&rep=rep1&type=pdf}{\tt http\+://citeseerx.\+ist.\+psu.\+edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.\+1.\+1.\+108.\+7376\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{_reservoir_sample_8h}{Reservoir\+Sample.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A special weighted reservoir sampling class that allows for logarithmic weights to do this, we use a transformation following \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Weighted_random_sampling_using_Reservoir}{\tt https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Reservoir\+\_\+sampling\#\+Weighted\+\_\+random\+\_\+sampling\+\_\+using\+\_\+\+Reservoir} basically, we want to give a weight that is r$^\wedge$1/w, or log(r)/w, or log(log(r))-\/log(w). But the problem is that log(r) is negative so log(log(r)) is not defined. Instead, we\textquotesingle{}ll use the function f(x)=-\/log(-\/log(x)), which is monotonic. So then, -\/log(-\/log(r$^\wedge$1/w)) = -\/log(-\/log(r)/w) = -\/log(-\/log(r)$\ast$1/w) = -\/\mbox{[}log(-\/log(r)) -\/ log(w)\mbox{]} = -\/log(-\/log(r)) + log(w) \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{_streaming_statistics_8h}{Streaming\+Statistics.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A class to store a bunch of statistics about incoming data points, including min, max, mean, etc. This also stores a reservoir sample and allow us to compute how often one distribution exceeds another. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{_top_8h}{Top.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A TopN is a n object you can \char`\"{}add\char`\"{} hypotheses to (via add or $<$$<$) and it stores the best N of them. This is widely used in \hyperlink{namespace_fleet}{Fleet} in order to find good approximations to the top hypotheses found in M\+C\+TS or M\+C\+MC. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
