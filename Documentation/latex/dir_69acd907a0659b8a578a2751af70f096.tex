\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A preprimitive is a class that primitives inherit. We use a static op\+\_\+counter so that at compile time thsi can be used to compute an op number for each separate primitive. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This manages a collection of Virtual\+Machines -- this is what handles the enumeration of flip by probability. Basically each machine state stores the state of some evaluator and is able to push things back on to the Q if it encounters a random flip This stores pointers because it is impossible to copy out of std collections, so we are constantly having to call \hyperlink{class_virtual_machine_state}{Virtual\+Machine\+State} constructors. Using pointers speeds us up by about 20\%. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{_virtual_machine_state_8h}{Virtual\+Machine\+State.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This represents the state of a partial evaluation of a program, corresponding to the value of all of the stacks of various types (which are stored as templates from F\+L\+E\+E\+T\+\_\+\+G\+R\+A\+M\+M\+A\+R\+\_\+\+T\+Y\+P\+ES). The idea here is that we want to be able to encapsulate everything about the evaluation of a tree so that we can stop it in the middle and resume later, as is required for stochastics. This must be templated because it depends on the types in the grammar. These will typically be stored in a \hyperlink{class_virtual_machine_pool}{Virtual\+Machine\+Pool} and not called directly, unless you know that there are no stochastics. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
